`SSOReady.Client` is a C# SDK for the [SSOReady](https://ssoready.com) API.

SSOReady is a set of open-source dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You
can use SSOReady to add SAML and SCIM support to your product this afternoon.

For example applications built using SSOReady C#, check out:

- [SSOReady Example App: C# ASP.NET Core with SAML](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-example-app-csharp-aspnetcore-saml)

## Installation

```sh
nuget install SSOReady.Client
```

## Usage

This section provides a high-level overview of how SSOReady works, and how it's possible to implement SAML and SCIM in
just an afternoon. For a more thorough introduction, visit the [SAML
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) or the [SCIM
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/scim/scim-quickstart).

The first thing you'll do is create a SSOReady client instance:

```csharp
using SSOReady.Client;

// this loads your SSOReady API key from SSOREADY_API_KEY
var ssoready = new SSOReady.Client.SSOReady();
```

### SAML in two lines of code

SAML (aka "Enterprise SSO") consists of two steps: an _initiation_ step where
you redirect your users to their corporate identity provider, and a _handling_
step where you log them in once you know who they are.

To initiate logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Get SAML Redirect
URL](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/get-saml-redirect-url)
endpoint:

```csharp
// this is how you implement a "Sign in with SSO" button
var redirectResponse = await ssoready.Saml.GetSamlRedirectUrlAsync(new GetSamlRedirectUrlRequest
{
    // the ID of the organization/workspace/team (whatever you call it)
    // you want to log the user into
    OrganizationExternalId = email.Split("@")[1]
});

// redirect the user to `redirectResponse.RedirectUrl`...
```

You can use whatever your preferred ID is for organizations (you might call them
"workspaces" or "teams") as your `OrganizationExternalId`. You configure those
IDs inside SSOReady, and SSOReady handles keeping track of that organization's
SAML and SCIM settings.

To handle logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Redeem SAML Access
Code](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code) endpoint:

```csharp
// this goes in your handler for POST /ssoready-callback
var redeemResponse = await ssoready.Saml.RedeemSamlAccessCodeAsync(new RedeemSamlAccessCodeRequest
{
    SamlAccessCode = "saml_access_code_..."
});

// log the user in as `redeemResponse.Email` inside `redeemResponse.OrganizationExternalId`...
```

You configure the URL for your `/ssoready-callback` endpoint in SSOReady.

### SCIM in one line of code

SCIM (aka "Enterprise directory sync") is basically a way for you to get a list
of your customer's employees offline.

To get a customer's employees, you'll use SSOReady's [List SCIM
Users](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/scim/list-scim-users) endpoint:

```csharp
var listScimUsersResponse = await ssoready.Scim.ListScimUsersAsync(
    new ScimListScimUsersRequest { OrganizationExternalId = "my_custom_external_id" }
});

// create users from each scimUser
foreach (var scimUser in listScimUsersResponse.ScimUsers) {
    // every scimUser has an Id, Email, Attributes, and Deleted
    // ...
}
```
